Our event is now complete, which means we have the pull up totals, so we're sending you this email to inform you

Our records show that you pledged {{ amount_per_pullup }} to {{ marine_name }}. Your service member did {{ pullups }} pull ups,
which brings the total donation to {{ total }}.

We will charge your account in the middle of next week, so if there is any problem with this, please  contact the webmaster
