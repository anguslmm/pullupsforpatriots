Thank you for pledging a donation to Pull Ups for Patriots, {{ donor }}!

Our event is now complete, which means we have the pull up totals, so we're sending you this email to inform you
of what your total donation will be before we collect it from your PayPal account.

Our records show that you pledged ${{ amount_per_pullup }} to "{{ marine_name }}". Your service member did {{ pullups }} pull ups,
which brings the total donation to ${{ total }}.

Note: If you recieved multiple copies of the same email, we may have a duplicate pledge. This may cause you to be charged twice. We
will do a sweep to attempt to avoid this, but we encourage you to contact the webmaster at anguslmm@gmail.com. If you pledged an
amount to a marine who did not do any pull ups on the day of the event, your total above should read 0, and you will not be charged.

We will charge your account in the middle of next week, so if there is any problem with this, please contact the webmaster
at anguslmm@gmail.com immediately so that we can get it resolved quickly.

Thank you so much for supporting Pull ups for Patriots, Hope for the Warriors, and all the service members involved!

-PO2 (IW) Angus McLean, Webmaster.
